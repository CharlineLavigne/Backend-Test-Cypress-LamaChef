# Back-End Testing of LamaChef

This project is an automation example of the LamaChef application using Cypress and Postman (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

*Note that the developer of LamaChef has not yet made the application available on GitHub so it is not testable without an autorization access. This simple project is only an example of basic API requests.*

## Launch

In the project root folder run :

1. `npm install`
2. `npx cypress open`
